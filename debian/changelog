ros-kilted-urg-node (1.1.1-4bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * add branch information
  * add license file, same as ROS1
  * increased delay in diagnostics thread to slow down publish rate (#102 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/102>)
    This is just a quick PR to increase the thread sleep in the diagnostics thread. Currently the diagnostics status is updated at ~96hz. Which is way too fast and really messes with the Frequency Status Monitor which jumps between too low and too high
  * Added URDF for UST10. (#103 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/103>)

ros-kilted-urg-node (1.1.0-4bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Merge pull request #86 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/86> from ros-drivers/clalancette/galactic-fixes
    Fixes for ROS 2 Galactic
  * Don't error out on unknown parameter names.
    In general, parameter callbacks should not error out on unknown
    parameter names.  That's because a) the callbacks may be
    chained, and b) there may be internal parameters that are used.
    Just ignore anything we don't know about.
  * Switch to PRIu32 for printing a uint32_t.
    This just ensures that it works on all platforms, and
    removes a warning on Galactic.
  * Fix rclcpp::Duration construction.
    As of Galactic, initializing an rclcpp::Duration with just
    a number is deprecated.  We now have to explicitly tell it
    the units of the number, generally done through std::chrono.
  * Remove unused reconfigure method.

ros-kilted-urg-node (1.0.3-4bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Use Python 3 specifically in helper script (#85 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/85>)
    ROS 2 only targets Python 3. Making the shebang specific will ensure it
    isn't accidentally executed using the Python 2 interpreter.
  * travis-ci doesn't work
    But ros build farm is giving us coverage
  * depend only on parts of boost needed by the package (#75 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/75>)

ros-kilted-urg-node (0.1.11-4bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Add support for URG-04LX in SCIP 1.1 mode
    The urg_node does not support SCIP 1.1. The Hokuyo URG-04LX supports both
    SCIP 1.1 and SCIP 2.0, but needs to be switched to SCIP 2.0 at every startup
    in its default configuration. For this purpose the function
    URGCWrapper::setToSCIP2() was added.
    A URG-04LX in SCIP 1.1 mode used to lead to an exception being thrown in
    URGCwrapper::initialize. Now, before throwing the exception an attempt to
    switch the sensor to SCIP 2.0 is made.
  * Fixed comments in launch file and added roslaunch.
  * Add flag to prevent updating of detailed status.
    If using a model that does not support AR00 command, hide it
    behind a rosparam.
  * Add safety stop heading and distance values (#28 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/28>)
    Added to the laser status field the last report of a safety
    stop of distance and angle reported. If this fails or is unavailable
    it will just report 0.
  * Updating depend and roslint.
    Fixing some roslint error after moving a header name.
    Additionally fixing the gencfg to be on the lib and not the node.
  * Adding missing std_srvs depend.
    Adding missing std_srvs depend to package.xml and CMakelists.txt
  * Move urg_node to be a library.
    Moving urg_node to urg_node_driver as a library.
    This allows for other nodes to include this as an object instead
    of spawning another separate process.
  * Add getAR00 status command.
    Added ability to pull the status of the lidar AR00 status command.
    This then publishes a latched topic with the current status of the
    lidar's error code and lockout status.
  * Update urg_node to be a self contained class
    Updating urg node to be a self contained class. This allows
    for it to be imported in other nodes.
  * Roslint
