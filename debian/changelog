ros-rolling-urg-node (1.1.2-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * README syntax updates (#112 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/112>)
    Updates to ROS 2 syntax and minor rewording. I also moved RViz to the
    visualization section.
    Fixes #79 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/79>
  * Prevent diagnostics segfault by accessing empty urg_ pointer (#107 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/107>)
    This PR prevents a potential segfault in the populateDiagnostics
    function, when the driver disconnects the urg_ pointer is reset. If the
    diagnostics function is in the middle of execution (it runs in a
    separate thread) at the time it will try to call a function on an empty
    pointer. This happened more frequently before
    [PR-102](https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/pull/102) but it still
    could potentially happen.
    The populateDiagnostics function is accessing urg_ for things that are
    static or it already has access to via local variables so I've just
    refactored the function so it only accesses urg_ to check if it exists.
  * Fixed signed to unsigned conversion error in sendCommand (#105 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/105>)
    Fixes a bug in the
    [sendCommand](https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/blob/1166ab25aab1d085183f7f6de42d3bf562c127a7/src/urg_c_wrapper.cpp#L328)
    function, socket read returns a sstize_t which was being converted to an
    unsigned (size_t).
    If a read error occurs it will return -1 which is converted to SIZE_MAX
    (18446744073709551615 on our machines) and then added to the
    total_read_len which wraps around to same value it had already (so the
    loop termination condition is never reached) and also fools the error if
    statement because it's greater than 0.
  * Empty return value from sendCommand causes a crash (#104 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/104>)
    A quick bug fix, I found that an error in the
    [sendCommand](https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/blob/1166ab25aab1d085183f7f6de42d3bf562c127a7/src/urg_c_wrapper.cpp#L328)
    function in urg_c_wrapper returns an empty string. However none of the
    callers are checking for an empty string so this results in an unhandled
    std::out_of_range exception:
    ```
    [urg_node_driver-25] [ERROR 1679511084.962595117] [urg_node_front_left_node]: Buffer creation bounds exceeded, shouldn't allocate: 4294967291 bytes (sendCommand() at /root/v2.0.6/src/urg_node/src/urg_c_wrapper.cpp:597)
    [urg_node_driver-25] terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
    [urg_node_driver-25]   what():  basic_string::erase: __pos (which is 18446744073709551615) > this->size() (which is 0)
    [ERROR] [urg_node_driver-25]: process has died [pid 42882, exit code -6, cmd '/
    ```
    This PR just adds an empty string check in the two callers to prevent
    the crash. There are probably not many people using the detailed status
    but we're using it on the UAM-05LP-T301 to get the error codes so very
    useful to get this fixed.

ros-rolling-urg-node (1.1.1-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * add branch information
  * add license file, same as ROS1
  * increased delay in diagnostics thread to slow down publish rate (#102 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/102>)
    This is just a quick PR to increase the thread sleep in the diagnostics thread. Currently the diagnostics status is updated at ~96hz. Which is way too fast and really messes with the Frequency Status Monitor which jumps between too low and too high
  * Added URDF for UST10. (#103 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/103>)

ros-rolling-urg-node (1.1.0-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Merge pull request #86 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/86> from ros-drivers/clalancette/galactic-fixes
    Fixes for ROS 2 Galactic
  * Don't error out on unknown parameter names.
    In general, parameter callbacks should not error out on unknown
    parameter names.  That's because a) the callbacks may be
    chained, and b) there may be internal parameters that are used.
    Just ignore anything we don't know about.
  * Switch to PRIu32 for printing a uint32_t.
    This just ensures that it works on all platforms, and
    removes a warning on Galactic.
  * Fix rclcpp::Duration construction.
    As of Galactic, initializing an rclcpp::Duration with just
    a number is deprecated.  We now have to explicitly tell it
    the units of the number, generally done through std::chrono.
  * Remove unused reconfigure method.

  * Use Python 3 specifically in helper script (#85 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/85>)
    ROS 2 only targets Python 3. Making the shebang specific will ensure it
    isn't accidentally executed using the Python 2 interpreter.
  * travis-ci doesn't work

ros-rolling-urg-node (0.1.11-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Add support for URG-04LX in SCIP 1.1 mode
    The urg_node does not support SCIP 1.1. The Hokuyo URG-04LX supports both
    SCIP 1.1 and SCIP 2.0, but needs to be switched to SCIP 2.0 at every startup
    in its default configuration. For this purpose the function
    URGCWrapper::setToSCIP2() was added.
    A URG-04LX in SCIP 1.1 mode used to lead to an exception being thrown in
    URGCwrapper::initialize. Now, before throwing the exception an attempt to
    switch the sensor to SCIP 2.0 is made.
  * Fixed comments in launch file and added roslaunch.
  * Add flag to prevent updating of detailed status.
    If using a model that does not support AR00 command, hide it
    behind a rosparam.
  * Add safety stop heading and distance values (#28 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/28>)
    Added to the laser status field the last report of a safety
    stop of distance and angle reported. If this fails or is unavailable
    it will just report 0.
  * Updating depend and roslint.
    Fixing some roslint error after moving a header name.
    Additionally fixing the gencfg to be on the lib and not the node.
  * Adding missing std_srvs depend.
    Adding missing std_srvs depend to package.xml and CMakelists.txt
  * Move urg_node to be a library.
    Moving urg_node to urg_node_driver as a library.
    This allows for other nodes to include this as an object instead
    of spawning another separate process.
  * Add getAR00 status command.
    Added ability to pull the status of the lidar AR00 status command.
    This then publishes a latched topic with the current status of the
    lidar's error code and lockout status.
  * Update urg_node to be a self contained class
    Updating urg node to be a self contained class. This allows
    for it to be imported in other nodes.
  * Roslint
